 This is it. The house. The old mansion on the hill that had been the center of all sorts of chilling stories told by the neighbourhood children. Some said that it was haunted and most people who ventured in never lived to tell the tale. Others claimed that an old eccentric hermit resided in the dark basement and consumed the blood and flesh of homosapiens to stay alive. All the unsubstantiated claims had fanned the flames of my interest. Therefore, I mustered up my courage and ventured into the mansion alone, armed with a camcorder equipped with night vision.
